My name is **Sean Dearnaley**, I’m a software engineer, a music producer, and a technology enthusiast. I was born in England. I moved around a lot as a child (my father was in the army), I lived in Germany for 3 years and moved to Ireland when when I was 10 years old.

I’ve been developing applications since I was a teenager. I started a popular music website when I was 14 and I’ve been producing music under the artist name **[Human Being](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4h5wHTiBLKxl91tKgOW6XW?si=DD_PmghZQ-idyIDhm5UsOA)** since 1998.  I built up a large following with my music website TheDSC, in 1997 I was fortunate enough to win several internationally recognized awards which allowed me to move to the United States. I was hired to write for the popular hip-hop group **[Wu-Tang Clan](https://wutangclan.com/)**. 

In 2002 I began developing commercial applications for governments and corporations. I worked on many projects, including intranet systems for the **[United Nations (the International Atomic Energy Agency)](https://www.iaea.org/)**, an ISO 9000 management system for **[British Oxygen](https://www.boconline.co.uk/)** and several intranet systems for companies like **[Sterilite](https://www.sterilite.com/)**, **[Intel](https://www.intel.com/)**, and **Compaq**.  I spent several years working on Homelessness Management Systems with [Simtech Solutions](http://www.simtechsolutions.com/). I did significant work for the United States Federal Government working on databases, advanced reporting and several mobile applications for homelessness and social service platforms (**Point In Time**, **[Counting.Us](https://counting.us/)**). 

During my CS studies in Liverpool, England, I contributed to the development of the Binary Cell, the cities first surround sound studio/ a collaboration with several Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts alumni,

In 2017 I worked as a Principal Engineer for a large education company in the Boston area, I worked on a lesson delivery pipeline providing education to 6 million kids across the United States.

Today I work for [Indigo AG](https://www.indigoag.com/), a AG-Tech startup based in Boston, MA.
