Meet Sean Dearnaley - a software engineer, music producer, and technology enthusiast. Born in England and raised in a family with a military background, Sean moved around frequently as a child, including a 3-year stay in Germany before finally settling in Ireland at the age of 10.

With a passion for technology, Sean began developing applications at a young age. At 14, he started a successful music website, and since 1998, has been producing music under the artist name [Human Being](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4h5wHTiBLKxl91tKgOW6XW?si=DD_PmghZQ-idyIDhm5UsOA). His early success led to recognition and awards, eventually allowing him to move to the United States and write for the legendary hip-hop group [Wu-Tang Clan](https://wutangclan.com/).

With over two decades of experience in the field, Sean has a proven track record of delivering innovative solutions for governments and corporations. He has worked on a variety of projects, including intranet systems for the [International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations](https://www.iaea.org/), an ISO 9000 management system for [British Oxygen](https://www.boconline.co.uk/), and several intranet systems for companies such as [Sterilite](https://www.sterilite.com/), [Intel](https://www.intel.com/), and Compaq. Sean also spent several years working on homelessness management systems with [Simtech Solutions](http://www.simtechsolutions.com/), contributing to the development of databases, advanced reporting, and mobile applications for homelessness and social service platforms.

While studying Computer Science at Liverpool, England, Sean had the opportunity to contribute to the development of the Binary Cell, the city's first surround sound studio in collaboration with several alumni of the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts. Later, as a Principal Engineer for a large education company in the Boston area, Sean worked on a lesson delivery pipeline that provided education to 6 million children across the United States.

Today, Sean is a part of the team at [Indigo AG](https://www.indigoag.com/), a cutting-edge ag-tech startup based in Boston, MA.
