OpenAI has rolled out several exciting updates that improve the capabilities of its GPT models while making them more cost-effective. In my latest Medium article, [Transforming Reddit Summarization With Claude 100k and GPT 16k](https://betterprogramming.pub/transforming-reddit-summarization-with-claude-100k-and-gpt-16k-4e2592d850cf), I delve into these key changes, including the introduction of a new function calling capability in the Chat Completions API, updated and more steerable versions of gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo, and a new 16k context version of gpt-3.5-turbo.

The Reddit GPT Summarizer has been updated to support these new models. The enhancements revolve around the integration of advanced language models from OpenAI and Anthropic, specifically Anthropic’s new Claude model that boasts a staggering 100,000 token context window. These enhancements allow the application to delve deeper into extensive threads, understand relationships and themes across a larger textual canvas, and generate comprehensive summaries.

In the article, you'll find:

- The evolution of the Reddit Summarizer
- The capabilities of the language models employed and their impact on the application’s performance
- The competitive dynamics between the models and how leveraging a blend of these models can lead to powerful applications
