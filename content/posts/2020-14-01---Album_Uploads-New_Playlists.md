I took a moment today to refresh my soundcloud music, and finally got round to making playlists + upload the remaining tracks from 'Extraordinary Rendition' and 'Gravity Loves Company', I did these records a long time ago but there is still some good stuff on there... Gravity was a bit of a glitchy phase but interesting stuff came out of that project.  Extraordinary was inspired by the EDM/Dubstep scene that was big at the time, it definitely has some bangers, worth listening to.
