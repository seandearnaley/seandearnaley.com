I've recently built a Reddit Thread Summarizer using Python, Streamlit, PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper), and the ChatGPT API. The goal of this project was to harness the power of ChatGPT to automatically summarize comment threads on Reddit, making it easier for users to get the gist of lengthy discussions.

In this article, I share my experience, insights, and code snippets, providing a valuable starter kit for those who want to experiment with GPT-based applications. To guide you through the process, I've also uploaded a YouTube video that accompanies this article.

The project began as a simple idea that I planned to complete in a day or two, but as I explored advanced techniques like recursive summarization, the scope expanded. I eventually decided to save some of the more complex features for a follow-up article.

This Reddit Thread Summarizer is the result of my experimentation with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that adds context to text prompts. I was impressed by RAG's ability to generate coherent summaries from comment threads and wanted to automate this process for Reddit.
