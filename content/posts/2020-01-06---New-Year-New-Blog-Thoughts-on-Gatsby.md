# Happy New Year!

Welcome to my new blog, here I'm going to be sharing my work, my thoughts, new music and articles/tutorials.   I've been meaning to start this site for a while, but I wanted to make sure that I had something to say.

## What to expect from this blog

I'm trying to write a new article every two weeks.  I will be focusing on software development, science and technology, hopefully I will also have a chance to touch upon electronic music and interleave my passions.

## How I made this site: GatsbyJS / Netlify / Lumen

I made this site in less than 24 hrs using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and the [Lumen Gatsby Starter Kit](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen), hosting is provided by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).  I've made the source code available on [Github](https://github.com/seandearnaley/seandearnaley.com).   Gatsby is an open source framework based on [React](https://reactjs.org/).  I had a really good experience working with it, basically it allows users to generate static sites from markdown, it makes great use of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and has a great user eco-system of plugins, themes and starter kits.

I did run into some gotcha's using WSL 2 but overall I was impressed at the level of customization and ease of use.   The [Lumen Gatsby Starter Kit](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) really helped get this up and running quickly and I integrated it with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to update the content easily.

I'm going to be digging deeper into these frameworks later, I'm writing an article about Gatsby JS but this was as a great opportunity to get my feet wet with the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/).
